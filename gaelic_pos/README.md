### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for anyone who would like to use a Scottish Gaelic part-of-speech tagger or tokeniser, or contribute to the project. 

In order to run the tagger, you will need to have Python 3 installed. The software incorporates open-source Python modules developed for NLTK 3.0 (Natural Language Toolkit: http://www.nltk.org). 

If you are interested in training your own tagger, you can use the input files in the 'Training_file' folder. These are provided in csv format. A tagged corpus of Scottish Gaelic (ARCOSG), in Brown format ('/'), is also available at the following URL:

See the AboutFile.txt for more information.
